## [ZENCash](https://zensystem.io/) Desktop GUI Wallet binary release 0.75.9a for Mac OS

This is a [ZENCash](https://zensystem.io/) Desktop GUI Wallet binary release 0.75.9a for Mac OS. 
It includes [ZENCash 2.0.11 binaries](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/releases/tag/v2.0.11).
Originally the release was created with ZENCash 2.0.10-1 binaries but was upgraded to 2.0.11 due to
stability issues.

One notable new feature is the ability to send encrypted text messages in group conversations on the ZEN blockchain. It is also possible to block/ignore other users if they are spamming the conversation.

### IMPORTANT: Please read the [security notice](KnownSecurityIssues.md) about watch-only addresses before using the wallet!

### Installing the ZENCash Desktop GUI Wallet on Mac OS

1. Download the Wallet image file 
[ZENCashWallet-0.75.9a.dmg](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zencash-swing-wallet-ui/releases/download/0.75.9/ZENCashWallet-0.75.9a.dmg). 

2. Security check: You may decide to run a virus scan on it before proceeding... In addition using a tool 
such as [http://quickhash-gui.org/](http://quickhash-gui.org/) you may calculate the its SHA256 checksum. The 
result should be:
```
10c68899f23055eaa036f83f8a0f1799ee057103080585ce3dc12779df760ffc  ZENCashWallet-0.75.9a.dmg
```
**If the resulting checksum is not `10c68899f23055eaa036f83f8a0f1799ee057103080585ce3dc12779df760ffc` then**
**something is wrong and you should discard the downloaded wallet!**

3. You need to (at least temporarily) allow the installation of "apps downloaded from anywhere" on your Mac. 
[This article](http://osxdaily.com/2016/09/27/allow-apps-from-anywhere-macos-gatekeeper/) is a good description
of how to do this. This step will not be necessary in future releases. 

4. Install the wallet like any other downloaded Mac OS application: Open the disk image `ZENCashWallet-0.75.9a.dmg`
and copy the ZENCashWallet application to the Applications folder. You can then discard the disk image.
   
### Running the ZENCash Desktop GUI Wallet on Mac OS

Simply click on ZENCashWallet in the Mac OS application launchpad.

### Known issues and limitations
1. Limitation: The list of transactions does not show all outgoing ones (specifically outgoing Z address 
transactions).  
1. Limitation: if two users exchange text messages via the messaging UI TAB and one of them has a system clock, substantially running slow or fast by more than 1 minute, it is possible that this user will see text messages appearing out of order. 
1. Limitation: if a messaging identity has been created (happens on first click on the messaging UI tab), then replacing the `wallet.dat` or changing the node configuration between mainnet and testnet will make the identity invalid. This will result in a wallet update error. To remove the error the directory `~/.ZENCashSwingWalletUI/messaging` may be manually renamed or deleted (when the wallet is stopped). **CAUTION: all messaging history will be lost in this case!**
