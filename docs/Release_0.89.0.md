## [Horizen](https://horizen.io/) Desktop GUI Wallet binary release 0.898.0

It includes [Horizen 2.0.20 binaries](https://github.com/HorizenOfficial/zen/releases/tag/v2.0.20). 

**This wallet is targeted at advanced users who understand the implications of running a full Zen node on**
**the local machine, maintaining a full local copy of the blockchain, maintaining and backing up the**
**Zen nodes's `wallet.dat` file etc! The wallet is not suitable for novice crypto-currency users!**

**SECURITY WARNING: Encryption of the wallet.dat file is not yet supported for Horizen. Using the wallet** 
**on a system infected with malware may result in wallet data/funds being stolen. The**
**wallet.dat needs to be backed up regularly (not just once - e.g. after every 30-40**
**outgoing transactions) and it must also be backed up after creating a new Z address.**

**STABILITY WARNING: The GUI wallet is as yet considered experimental! It is known to exhibit occasional stability problems related to running a full Zen node.**
**Specifically if the locally running `zend` cannot start properly due to issues with the local blockchain, the GUI cannot start either!**
**Users need to be prepared to fix such problems manually as described in the [troubleshooting guide](TroubleshootingGuide.md).**
**Doing so requires command line skills.**

**AUTO-DEPRECATION WARNING: Wallet binary releases for Mac/Windows contain ZEN full node binaries. These have an auto-deprecation feature:**
**they are considered outdated after 16 weeks and stop working. So they need to be updated to a newer version before this term expires.**
**Users need to ensure they use an up-to-date version of the wallet (e.g. update the wallet every two months or so).**

### Some known issues and limitations
1. If a system has a high resolution monitor with DPI scaling enabled, not all GUI elements scale alike.
As a result the Wallet UI may feel inconvenient to use at scaling above 1.5x or even unusable at scaling above 3x.
This problem will be fixed in future versions.
1. Limitation: The list of transactions does not show all outgoing ones (specifically outgoing Z address 
transactions).
